# Vue 2 application with webpack 4 boilerplate

This repo was created from a base derived from [this article](https://medium.com/js-dojo/how-to-configure-webpack-4-with-vuejs-a-complete-guide-209e943c4772) published on Medium

Use npm [version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version.html) command with -m option to auto bump version with comment prior to pushing to repository:

```
> npm version prepatch -m This is a prepatch version to hold changes made today
```

Then use do a commit and push (does tortisegit retain the comment made?)

Eventually add scripts to run tests as part of version upgrades and auto commit and push to github
